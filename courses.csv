In the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about a movie you liked or a book you didn’t like or a product you bought was not up to the mark. Therefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customer’s opinion. It is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis. On what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis? There are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases: Sentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well. Analyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not. For other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/ What is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?
